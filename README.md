# Contributing
* Create a directory for your concept.
* Keep the files of the topic local to the directory.
* Try to use CDN for CSS/JS dependencies instead of putting them in repository.
* Please discuss the design/outline of what you are making before starting to code. `Illustrations/sketches` would help.
* Including a help text/links to understand the underlying concepts would be a bonus.
